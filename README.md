# CrossReference

The aim of this repository is to collect the translations of referencing different objects inside the document, such as images, tables, listings, chapters, etc. 
The way in which items are cited inside the document changes from a language to another. 
It should not be not only a one to one translation, but the standards in each language are different.

# Label and reference distinction

Labels are clearly different from references, for instance `Figure 1` could be referenced as `Figure 1` or `Fig. 1` depending on the context and the style used by the author.
